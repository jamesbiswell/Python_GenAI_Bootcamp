# Key Python Operators: Assignment, Comparison, and Identity Operators

# Assignment Operator
a = 5

# Augmented Assignment Operators
a += 2  # Equivalent to: a = a + 2
print(a)  # Output: 7

a -= 4  # Equivalent to: a = a - 4
print(a)  # Output: 3

# Other augmented assignment operators: *=, /=, **=, %=, //=
a *= 10  # Equivalent to: a = a * 10
print(a)  # Output: 30

# Incrementing and decrementing
a += 1  # Equivalent to: a = a + 1
a -= 1  # Equivalent to: a = a - 1

# Comparison Operators == ; != ; > ; >= ; < ; <=
a, b = 10, 5
print(a == b)  # False: Checks if a is equal to b
print(a > b)   # True: Checks if a is greater than b



# Identity Operators: 'is' and 'is not'
# 'is' checks if two variables reference the same object in memory

a = 2
print(id(a))    # Prints the memory address of a

b = 2
print(id(b))    # Prints the memory address of b - the same since integers are immutable

print(a is b)   # True: Both reference the same object

a += 3          # Modifies the value of a
print(id(a))    # Memory address changes since integers are immutable

# Identity check with mutable objects
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(id(numbers))  # Prints the memory address of the list
numbers.append(10)  # Modifies the list (mutable)
print(id(numbers))  # Memory address remains the same

l1 = [3, 6]
id1 = id(l1)
l1.append(9)
id2 = id(l1)
print(id1 == id2)
